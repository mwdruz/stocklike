Big picture:
as a gui user I want to be able to collect, process and visualize meaningful statistics of "well-defined product" offers
from auction sites.

(MVP) Story A:

- as a gui user I want to be able to enter product name and be presented with an offer price histogram of all currently
  available offers.

Story B:

- as a gui user I want to be able to define queries that will be monitored at time intervals

Story C:

- as a gui user I want to see a plot of changes of some market statistics with time
