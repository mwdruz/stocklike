Big picture:
as a gui user I want to be able to collect, process and visualize meaningful statistics of "well-defined product" offers from auction sites.

(MVP) Story A:

- as a gui user I want to be able to enter product name and be presented with a histogram of prices of all currently available offers.

Story B:

- as a gui user I want to be able to define queries that will be performed at time intervals

Story C:

- as a gui user I want to see a plot of changes in time of some market statistics associated with given product
